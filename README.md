# Exploratory Data Analysis: Melbourne Housing Market

In this project for Mathematical Foundations of Data Analysis Course from the Big Data Master an Exploratory Data Analysis and Linear Regression Model is done using R and Melbourne Housing Market dataset.

This dataset can be downloaded from Kaggle website: https://www.kaggle.com/anthonypino/melbourne-housing-market

The dataset includes data from houses sold in the real state market of Melbourne (Australia), price, address, suburb, number of rooms, real state agent...


EDA_MelbourneHousingMarket_Project contains:
- script_Rmarkdown.Rmd: is the main script where the code was written using R markdown.
- script_Rmarkdown.md: file generated from the main one that makes easy to visualize inputs and outputs of the notebook in GitHub, following GitHub format.
- script_Rmarkdown.html: html file generated from the main script, best way to visualize, but downloading the file is needed.
- data: directory that contains the housing dataset in csv format.
- leaflet_files: directory that contains the html code for the two plots generated using leaflet library (downloading the file is needed).
- script_Rmarkdown_files/figure-html: directory that contains all the figures (png format) from the html file.


For execution:
- Download script_Rmarkdown.Rmd file and data directory and execute the script. This will generate script_Rmarkdown.md and script_Rmarkdown.html files for better visualization of the results.


To visualize the output of the code:
- Best way is to download the html file and open it using your browser (this way requires downloading files).
- Opening script_Rmarkdown.md you can visualize online all the inputs and outputs of the code except the two plots generated with leaflet library that require html for the visualization. To visualize leaflet plots download the files in leaflet_files directory and open them with your browser.
